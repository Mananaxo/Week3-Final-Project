# Week3-Final-Project (FNB App Academy)

This is the Pine City Zoo Project

This is my Week 3 Final Project â€” a simple, mobile-friendly web app with multiple pages: Home, Animals, Places, and Contact.

## **About the Project**

- Built with **HTML** and **CSS**
- Fully responsive layout with a fixed header, top tabs, and bottom navigation
- Each section has **info boxes** with images, headings, and descriptions

## ðŸŽ¨ **Special Styling**

- I added a **hover effect** for the **Animals** and **Places** pages

## How to Run

Open index.html in your browser.

Click through the tabs and pages â€” hover over the Animals and Places boxes to see the glow effect.
